### **Experience Authentic PS1 Aesthetics!**

We've painstakingly crafted a visual experience that captures the raw charm and technical quirks of your favorite PlayStation 1 classics:

*   **Signature "Wobble" Effect:** Witness the iconic vertex jitter as objects subtly shift, a true homage to the PlayStation's GTE precision.
*   **Affine Texture "Swimming":** Relish in the classic "swimming" textures, where surfaces deform and stretch, adding to the unique visual character.
*   **Crisp Low-Poly Models:** Drive beautifully blocky cars and race across tracks built with purposeful polygon budgets, reminiscent of the era's hardware limitations.
*   **Vibrant 15-bit Color & Dithering:** Our custom color quantization and Bayer matrix dithering bring the 32-bit color palette to life with authentic, pixelated gradients.
*   **Immersive Distance Fog:** Lose yourself in the atmospheric depth provided by adjustable fog, a classic PS1 technique for concealing draw distance limits.
*   **Revolutionary Pre-Baked Lighting:** Experience surprisingly dynamic lighting with custom pre-baked **Bent Normals**. This advanced technique provides nuanced ambient occlusion, realistic sky light, and ground bounce, elevating the low-poly aesthetic with sophisticated, era-appropriate shading.
